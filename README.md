# pingrede
can you map a network without nmap?
recently in a pentesting the contractor asked me not to use nmap
so I created some tools to replace here goes one
how does it work? she uses the interface ping and at the end of the ip where the host counts pass a sequence.
so we can see which hosts are active on that network.
